"""
Take the following IPv4 address: 128.32.10.1

This address has 4 octets where each octet is a single byte (or 8 bits).

    1st octet 128 has the binary representation: 10000000
    2nd octet 32 has the binary representation: 00100000
    3rd octet 10 has the binary representation: 00001010
    4th octet 1 has the binary representation: 00000001

So 128.32.10.1 == 10000000.00100000.00001010.00000001

Because the above IP address has 32 bits, we can represent it as the unsigned 32 bit number: 2149583361

Complete the function that takes an unsigned 32 bit number and returns a string representation of its IPv4 address.
Examples

2149583361 ==> "128.32.10.1"
32         ==> "0.0.0.32"
0          ==> "0.0.0.0"
